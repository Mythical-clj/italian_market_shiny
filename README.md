# italian_market_shiny
## This is a shiny app for checking out the data of an Italian farmer's market stand

The purpose of this project is to explore the sales trends across the year 2024. 

The data was gathered via the square app [link here] and was cleaned using python. The data 
used can be found [here].

The first graph allows for the selection of overall sales of each item on the menu,
 comparing different items at the same time. The choices lets you decide whether you want 
 to select either gross sales or net sales, and then net_total and total_collected.
 A calendar selection allows for the view of the sales of certain date ranges.

 There are three tabs. The first with the interactive graphs, a second with the description of
of each item selected as well as a table with their summary statistics in a table.
The third tab will be one model's results taking up the entire tab. The choices will be a 
linear regression model, an ANOVA, or a a written analysis of what the interpretation of the
p-value means

The trends of only one year is subject to swings from seasonality, especially when coming
from an outdoor farmer's market. A goal of this project is to incorporate weather data as well into
the dates to see the impact of weather on sales data. A map of weather patterns over Saturdays and
Tuesdays only.
